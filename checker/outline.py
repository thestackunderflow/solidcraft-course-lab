"""Lesson 2: the J outline as the walk a viewer types (one line at a time: a direction and a length), and the numbers
SolidCraft should report for it, worked out here without SolidCraft: the profile area (shoelace rule), the bounding
box and the volume of the outline extruded by a width.

The J (side view, millimetres): back plate 60 tall and 5 thick, hook arm 25 deep (wall to the lip's front) and 5
thick, lip 10 high (from the bottom). Start at the origin, the bottom-left corner on the wall side."""
